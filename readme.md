# OH, did I get my JSON in your image?

I wanted to find a way to take a image and get a json format of the
"outline" of that image. Also, I needed something to talk about for an
upcoming talk for cincy js and I was in dire need of practice with d3
for an interview coming up. Three birds with one electric stone.

# Born from d3.js boilerplate

This came from a template for making a dashboard using d3.js along
with bootstrap, jquery-ui, and backbone. See
[the master branch of this repository](https://github.com/zmaril/d3.js-boilerplate#how-it-works)
for more information for the template system and philosophy behind
this project.
